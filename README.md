# the Complete App By App Brewery

During the journey of learning Mobile Application development using Flutter in the course by London App Brewery I have come across many interesting apps each was meant to introduce a new concept of Flutter programming.

In this repository, I am going to use Flutter to create a mobile application that contains all exercises and challenges demonstrated in The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart by App Brewery.
